        "# Profit & Loss Report Chatbot (RAG + SQL Agent)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook implements an advanced question-answering system for Profit and Loss (P&L) data analysis. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Google BigQuery Vector Storage, and LangChain to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to financial queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Technologies\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Powers natural language understanding and generation.\n",
        "- **Google BigQuery Vector Storage**: Stores and retrieves pre-analyzed financial data as vectors.\n",
        "- **LangChain**: Orchestrates the interaction between LLMs, vector storage, and SQL databases.\n",
        "- **SQL Agent**: Dynamically generates and executes SQL queries based on natural language questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Vector Store Retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "- Utilizes `BigQueryVectorStore` from LangChain for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "- Pre-analyzed financial reports are stored as vector embeddings.\n",
        "- `VertexAIEmbeddings` is used to generate embeddings for queries and documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. LLM-Powered Decision Making\n",
        "\n",
        "- `should_query_vector_store()` function uses an LLM to decide whether to query the vector store or use SQL.\n",
        "- LLM considers the question content, time frame, and available data to make this decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Dynamic SQL Query Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Employs LangChain's SQL Agent to convert natural language questions into SQL queries.\n",
        "- `create_sql_agent()` sets up an agent with access to database schema and query execution capabilities.\n",
        "- `SQLDatabaseToolkit` provides the agent with necessary tools for SQL operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Intelligent Question Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "- `extract_date_from_question()` uses regex and LLM capabilities to understand temporal aspects of queries.\n",
        "- `find_matching_values()` identifies relevant financial categories and groups mentioned in the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Answer Generation and Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Combines information from vector store and SQL queries to generate comprehensive answers.\n",
        "- `evaluate_answer_relevance()` uses an LLM to assess the relevance and quality of the generated answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## LangChain Components Used\n",
        "\n",
        "- `ChatOpenAI`: Interface for the LLM (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
        "- `ConversationChain`: Manages conversation context.\n",
        "- `LLMChain`: Executes specific LLM tasks like decision making and evaluation.\n",
        "- `PromptTemplate`: Structures prompts for consistent LLM interactions.\n",
        "- `SQLDatabase`: Provides an interface to the SQL database.\n",
        "- `BigQueryVectorStore`: Manages vector storage and retrieval in BigQuery.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup and Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install required packages:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   pip install langchain langchain-google-vertexai langchain-google-community google-cloud-bigquery sqlalchemy\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Set up Google Cloud credentials and BigQuery access.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Configure the notebook variables:\n",
        "   - `project`: Your Google Cloud project ID\n",
        "   - `dataset`: BigQuery dataset name\n",
        "   - `service_account_file`: Path to your Google Cloud service account key\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize the notebook components:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   main(reload_vector_storage=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Start the interactive query session:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   question = \"What was our revenue in May 2024?\"\n",
        "   response = ask_question(question)\n",
        "   print(response)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Customization\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modify `vector_store_content_description` to match your financial data structure.\n",
        "- Adjust `extract_date_from_question()` for different date formats.\n",
        "- Customize SQL views in `determine_view()` to match your database schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Advanced Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines vector similarity search with SQL queries for comprehensive answers.\n",
        "- **Dynamic Time Awareness**: Automatically adjusts queries based on the time frame mentioned in the question.\n",
        "- **Relevance Scoring**: Uses LLM to evaluate the quality and relevance of generated answers."
