Hi! Ask me a question about our company's profit and loss data : How was our performance in May 2024?

LLM Response for vector store query decision: Yes

The vector store is likely to contain information that can answer the question. The question asks about the company's performance in May 2024, which falls within the time frame covered by the vector store (February 2024 to September 2024). The vector store contains key metrics such as revenue, overheads, cost of delivery, gross and net profit, and retained earnings, which can be used to evaluate performance. It also includes month-over-month and year-to-date calculations, which can provide additional context for the performance in May 2024.
'Yes' found at the start of the response. Using vector store.

Based on the pre-created analysis: In May 2024, the company saw a significant increase in revenue, exceeding the budget by 64.3% and demonstrating a 101.79% increase compared to the previous month. This was primarily due to a new consulting contract with FinCorp Group. However, net profit fell short of budget by 1.5% due to increased costs in Delivery Team Wages and Shared Services. The revenue for May 2024 was £137,236.70, while the Cost of Delivery reached £-41,055.93. The Gross Margin for the month was £96,180.77, and Overheads reached £-20,415.31. The Net Profit for May 2024 was £75,765.46, and Retained Earnings reached £49,559.46.
